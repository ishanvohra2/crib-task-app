This is my submission for the task for SDE(Android) role at Crib. 
The application reads SMSs from the user's mobile device (after user grants permission) and counts the number of messages from a particular sender.

## Components used :
1. Jetpack navigation (Single activity architecture)
2. Coroutines for fetching the SMS data
